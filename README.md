Do you like building zoos in Minecraft, but have nobody to show them to? This mod adds a new set of npcs who will wander around your zoo and pay for the priviledge.

Simply build yourself a Zoo Donation Barrel and watch as vacationing villagers arrive to view your animals.

At the end of the day, zoogoers will leave emeralds in the donation barrel on their way out. The size of the donation will depend on the variety, quantity, and general impressiveness of the animals in your zoo (for example, livestock and animals found commonly in villages are not very impressive for a zoo, but still better than nothing).

As your zoo grows, you can build areas dedicated to specific kinds of animals. There are specialized zoogoers who prefer some kinds of animals over the rest:


*   Bird Watchers, who mostly want to see birds.
*   Fish Fans, who of course love aquatic animals.
*   Herp Enthusiats, who love reptiles and amphibians.
*   Monster Lovers, who are a bit too into monsters.
*   Star Gazers, who want to see animals from other dimensions.

This is best played along side mods that add a lot of new animals, and has built-in integration with Alex's Mobs, ZAWA, Exotic Birds, Aquaculture 2, Naturalist, Unusual Prehistory, Genetic Animals, Crazy Chocobos, The Endergetic Expansion, Ad Astra, and others.
